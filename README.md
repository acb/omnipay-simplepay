## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

This is a SimplePay gateway driver intended for testing purposes. If you provide a card number ending in an even number, the driver will return a success response. If it ends in an odd number, the driver will return a generic failure response. For example:

* 4929000000006 - Success
* 4444333322221111 - Failure
